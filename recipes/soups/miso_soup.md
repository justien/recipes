Miso Soup
=========


+ 1 tsp. bonito flakes
+ 1 sheet seaweed
+ 2. tbsp. miso paste
+ udon noodles
+ 4 spring onions, chopped
+ 1.5 c. water


Prepare the udon noodles as per the instructions on the package,
usually boiling for 5 minutes and then rinsing in cold water.

Put the water in a pot and add the bonito flakes and seaweed. Once it
boils reduce the heat to low.

Stir in the miso paste. **NOTE:** do not add miso to boiling water, it
changes the taste.

When the miso is dissolved, add the udon noodles. The noodles will
cool the soup, so heat it up again.

When soup temperature is reached, put it all in a large bowl. Garnish
with the chopped spring onion.
